# Pastebin Microservices Architecture Design

## System Overview

The Pastebin microservices architecture is designed to provide a scalable, high-availability paste-sharing service. The system is composed of four main microservices, each with specific responsibilities and independent deployment capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### 1. API Gateway (Port 5000)
- **Purpose**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Request routing and load balancing
  - API versioning
  - Rate limiting
  - Request/Response transformation
- **Design Justification**: 
  - Centralizes cross-cutting concerns
  - Simplifies client-side integration
  - Enables independent service evolution

### 2. Auth Service (Port 5001)
- **Purpose**: User authentication and authorization
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User registration and management
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - Session management
- **Design Justification**:
  - Separation of security concerns
  - Independent scaling of authentication load
  - Centralized user management

### 3. Paste Service (Port 5002)
- **Purpose**: Core paste management functionality
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Paste CRUD operations
  - Content storage and retrieval
  - Paste versioning
- **Design Justification**:
  - Independent scaling of core functionality
  - Simplified maintenance and updates
  - Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Analytics Service (Port 5003)
- **Purpose**: Usage tracking and analytics
- **Responsibilities**:
  - View count tracking
  - Usage pattern analysis
  - Performance metrics collection
- **Design Justification**:
  - Independent scaling of analytics processing
  - Reduced impact on core functionality
  - Specialized data storage for analytics

## Data Management

### Database Strategy
- **Separate Databases**: Each service has its own MySQL database
- **Benefits**:
  - Independent scaling
  - Service isolation
  - Reduced coupling
  - Simplified maintenance

### Data Consistency
- **Eventual Consistency**: Used for analytics data
- **Strong Consistency**: Used for core paste operations
- **Justification**: Balances performance with data accuracy requirements

## Performance and Scalability

### Load Testing
- **Tool**: Locust
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Response times
  - Throughput
  - Error rates
  - Resource utilization

### Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and alerting
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - Service health
  - Response times
  - Resource utilization
  - Error rates

## High Availability Features

1. **Containerization**:
   - Docker-based deployment
   - Independent service scaling
   - Easy rollback capabilities

2. **Database Persistence**:
   - Docker volumes for data persistence
   - Regular backup capabilities
   - Point-in-time recovery

3. **Service Resilience**:
   - Automatic restart policies
   - Circuit breaker patterns
   - Graceful degradation

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis for frequently accessed pastes
   - In-memory caching for authentication tokens
   - CDN for static content

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Health check monitoring
   - Dynamic scaling based on load

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Token expiration and refresh
   - Secure password storage

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - API key management

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypted communication
   - Secure database connections
   - Regular security audits

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Container Orchestration**:
   - Docker Compose for development
   - Kubernetes for production
   - Blue-green deployment support

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing
   - Continuous integration
   - Automated deployment

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Grafana for visualization
   - Custom dashboards for each service

2. **Logging**:
   - Centralized logging
   - Structured log format
   - Log aggregation

3. **Alerting**:
   - Threshold-based alerts
   - Service health monitoring
   - Performance degradation detection
